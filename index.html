    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        QuickFit ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy.
        This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information
        when you use our mobile application.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>
        QuickFit stores all your workout data locally on your device. We do not collect,
        transmit, or store any personal information on external servers. Your workout
        history, statistics, and preferences remain entirely on your device.
    </p>

    <h2>Local Data Stored</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Workout history (exercises, dates, durations)</li>
        <li>App preferences (sound, voice guidance, notifications)</li>
        <li>Statistics (total workouts, streaks)</li>
        <li>Premium subscription status</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Advertising</h2>
    <p>
        We use Google AdMob to display advertisements to free users. Google may collect
        certain data for ad personalization, including your device's advertising identifier
        and approximate location (IP-based), as described in
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.
        You can opt out of personalized advertising in your device settings. Premium
        users do not see advertisements.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>QuickFit uses the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Google AdMob — advertising for free users</li>
        <li>Google Play Services — app distribution</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Each of these services has its own privacy policy governing the use of your information.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
        We do not sell, trade, or transfer your personal data. The only third-party data
        sharing occurs through the Google AdMob SDK, which may collect device identifiers
        for advertising purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        All user data is stored locally on your device using encrypted storage. No data
        is transmitted to external servers. Internet access is used solely for loading
        advertisements.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>
        You can delete all your data at any time by going to <strong>Settings &gt; Clear All Data</strong>
        in the app. This permanently removes all workout history, statistics, and preferences.
        Uninstalling the app will also remove all locally stored data. Since no data is stored
        on external servers, deletion is immediate and complete.
    </p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>
        QuickFit does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
        The app is intended for general audiences interested in fitness and is not directed
        at children.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access your data (visible within the app's History and Stats screens)</li>
        <li>Delete your data (Settings &gt; Clear All Data)</li>
        <li>Export your data (Settings &gt; Export Workout Data)</li>
        <li>Opt out of personalized ads (via your device's ad settings)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected
        with an updated "Last updated" date at the top of this page.
    </p>
